# Gulp-Kirby-Starter-Kit
**You heard about Kirby and want to use it on your next project? You're' also excited about Gulp v4, but want to harness its power today? Then THIS is for you!**

Here's my personal (thus opinionated) Gulp+Kirby boilerplate, starring:
- [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) - a fileâ€‘based CMS that's 'easy to setup, easy to use & flexible as hell'
- [Gulp v4](http://gulpjs.com/) - the streaming build system

If you just want to have a look, feel free to do so with `php -S localhost:8000`. For an even **more opinionated version**, have a look at [this](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/Gulp-Kirby-Starter-Kit/tree/strong-opinion).


## Features
This boilerplate provides a solid starting point that you can build upon. Check `Gulpfile.js` or `package.json` to find out about all included features!

Workflow:
- Sass / node-sass / libsass
- Webpack
- Bourbon / Bitters
- Image optimization
- CSS / JS minification
- ...

Pre-installed Kirby plugins:
- Cache-busting via [kirby-fingerprint](https://github.com/iksi/KirbyFingerprint)
- HTML minification via [kirby-compress](https://github.com/iksi/kirby-compress)


## Getting started
Make sure [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system, then clone this repository (and all included submodules) and install its dependencies via [NPM](https://npmjs.org/):

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/Gulp-Kirby-Starter-Kit.git your-project
$ cd your-project
$ npm install
```

If you want to update all included submodules later on, it's just these two lines:

```bash
$ git submodule foreach --recursive git checkout master
$ git submodule foreach --recursive git pull
```

**Note: Before publishing your project, be sure to add your production `config.php` (eg `config.example.com.php`) to .gitignore!**

## Special Thanks
I'd like to thank everybody that's making great software - you people are awesome. Also I'm always thankful for feedback and bug reports :)
