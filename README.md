# Gulp-Kirby-Starter-Kit
**You heard about Kirby and want to use it on your next project? You're' also excited about Gulp v4, but want to harness its power today? Then THIS is for you!**

Here's my personal Gulp+Kirby boilerplate, starring:
- [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) - a fileâ€‘based CMS that's 'easy to setup, easy to use & flexible as hell'
- [Gulp v4](http://gulpjs.com/) - the streaming build system

If you just want to have a look, feel free to do so with `php -S localhost:8000`.


## Features
work in progress


## Getting started
Make sure [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system, then clone this repository and install its dependencies via [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).


## Special Thanks
I'd like to thank everybody that's making great software - you people are awesome. Also I'm always thankful for feedback and bug reports :)
